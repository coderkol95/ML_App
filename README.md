This was the second step after dataprep autoML/MLOps experiment.

A package is already there which does what I had set out to achieve. https://github.com/hyperopt/hyperopt-sklearn

I am currently using Azure MLOps. It is a fairly matured product. However its possible to run them only on cloud compute using cloud data storage AFAIK. MLOps can be locally achieved through mlflow: https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow

There is also TFX by Google.
